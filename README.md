# Word-Predictor-LSTM-

**Word Predictor using LSTM**

This repository contains a simple Word Predictor built using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The project was developed as a learning exercise to understand sequence prediction and natural language processing with deep learning.



**Features**

Model: Built using an LSTM architecture for sequence prediction.

Dataset: A small dataset was used, focusing on simplicity to enhance learning.

Performance: Achieved 94% accuracy on the chosen dataset.

Purpose: Educational and exploratory, not optimized for production use.



**How It Works**

The LSTM model is trained to predict the next word in a given sequence based on the patterns learned from the dataset. While the dataset is limited in size, it demonstrates the core functionality of word prediction effectively.



**Key Highlights**

1.Designed for understanding the working of LSTMs in NLP tasks.

2.Small-scale project to explore the basics of text generation.

3.High accuracy (94%) achieved on a simple dataset.



**Notes**
1.This project was developed purely for learning purposes.

2.Performance may vary with larger or more complex datasets.

3.Contributions and suggestions for improvement are welcome!



**Future Improvements**

1.Use a larger and more diverse dataset.

2.Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters.

3.Extend functionality to handle more complex sentence structures.
